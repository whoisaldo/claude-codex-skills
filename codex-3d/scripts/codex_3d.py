"""
codex_3d.py - build real 3D objects (three.js modules) and 2D vector objects
(SVG) by handing the modelling job to GPT-6-Astra through the Codex CLI, then
rendering the result headlessly so it can be inspected.

Auth: whatever `codex` is already logged in with (ChatGPT OAuth). No API key.

Pipeline (default `--passes 2`):
  1. build   codex exec (workspace-write, sandboxed to the build dir) writes
             ./object.js (or ./object.svg) to the contract in assets/.
  2. render  headless Chrome screenshots ./viewer.html -> preview.png and,
             for 3D, sheet.png (2x2 contact sheet). The viewer POSTs a status
             JSON (bounds, triangle count, parts, or the JS error) back to a
             throwaway local server, so failures are caught, not guessed.
  3. review  the same Codex thread is resumed with the renders attached and
             asked to fix what it can see. Render again.
Everything Codex may touch is confined to the build dir. Nothing else in the
project is read or written by this script.

`--format blender` swaps step 1: Astra models in a real Blender through the
Blender MCP server and exports ./object.glb (+ ./object.blend). The script
starts its own throwaway Blender on a free port for the run and makes it the
only MCP server Codex can see, so a Blender the user already has open (and
whatever is unsaved in it) is never touched. Blender itself runs outside the
Codex sandbox; the MCP server's safe mode keeps Astra's Python to bpy.

  tasteful, realistic default and proceed.
- ./viewer.html is exactly how the file will be consumed. Read it if anything
  about the contract is unclear.
- Finish with a short report: what you built, the list of named parts, how a
  caller animates it, and any compromises you made."""

THREE_CONTRACT = f"""\
You are acting as a headless 3D asset builder. Your only job is to write one
file, ./object.js, in the current working directory (a scratch build folder).

Contract for ./object.js - an ES module for three.js r{THREE_VERSION}:

    import * as THREE from 'three';
    // addons are fine, e.g.
    // import {{ RoundedBoxGeometry }} from 'three/addons/geometries/RoundedBoxGeometry.js';
    export function createObject() {{ ... return group; }}   // REQUIRED, returns a THREE.Group
    export function updateObject(group, t, dt) {{ ... }}     // OPTIONAL idle animation, t in seconds
    export const meta = {{ name: '...', size: [w, h, d], parts: ['...'] }};   // REQUIRED

Rules:
- Fully procedural: geometry + materials only. No textures, no fetch(), no
  URLs, no DOM, no lights, no cameras (the viewer supplies an environment
  map, key/rim lights and shadows).
- Y is up. The object rests on the ground plane y = 0, is centred on x = 0
  and z = 0, and its front faces +Z. Real-world metres: a car is ~4.5 m
  long, a mug ~0.1 m tall.
- Name every meaningful mesh and group (`mesh.name = 'wheel_fl'`) and put the
  animatable ones in `group.userData.parts = {{ wheel_fl: mesh, ... }}`.
- Materials: MeshStandardMaterial / MeshPhysicalMaterial with deliberate
  metalness, roughness, clearcoat, transmission where they sell the surface.
- Budget: under 200,000 triangles. Prefer fewer, better-shaped pieces.
- Quality bar: it must read as the real thing from every angle. Correct
  proportions, continuous silhouette, no gaps, no floating or intersecting
  parts, no z-fighting, symmetric where the object is symmetric. Build
  curved forms with LatheGeometry, ExtrudeGeometry with bevels, Shape-based
  hulls, TubeGeometry, CapsuleGeometry, RoundedBoxGeometry and edited
  BufferGeometry. A pile of plain boxes and cylinders is a failure unless the
  object really is boxes and cylinders.
- Before finishing run `node check.mjs` (it imports object.js and checks the
  contract, bounds, and triangle budget) and fix everything it reports until
  it prints OK.
{COMMON_RULES}"""

SVG_CONTRACT = f"""\
You are acting as a headless 2D vector asset builder. Your only job is to
write one file, ./object.svg, in the current working directory (a scratch
build folder).

Contract for ./object.svg - a standalone, hand-authored SVG:
- `viewBox` set, no `width`/`height` attributes, artwork fills the viewBox
  with a small margin.
- Pure vector: paths, shapes, gradients and filters. No <image>, no external
  hrefs, no web fonts, no <script>.
- Every meaningful part is a `<g id="...">` with a stable kebab-case id
  (`wheel-front`, `door-left`). Each animatable part is positioned with
  `transform="translate(x y)"` on its group so the group's local origin is
  its natural pivot (a wheel's centre, a hinge) and a caller can rotate or
  move it from CSS or JS.
- Literal hex colours. Share colours through <defs> gradients or repeated
  fills so recolouring is easy. No editor metadata, no redundant nesting or
  transforms, no default-valued attributes. Keep it under 200 KB.
- Quality bar: it must read as the real thing, not clip art. Accurate
  proportions and silhouette, considered line weights, shading through
  gradients, highlights and shadows where they sell the form. Match the
  medium the specification asks for (flat, outlined, isometric, technical).
- Before finishing validate it with `xmllint --noout object.svg` (if
  available) and fix any error.

    return f"""\
You are acting as a headless 3D asset builder. You model one object in a real
Blender through the MCP server `{MCP_SERVER}`, and you leave two files in the
current working directory (a scratch build folder, {build_dir}):
./object.blend (the editable source) and ./object.glb (what the page loads).

The Blender instance:
- It is a throwaway Blender started for this job. Call get_scene_info first:
  the scene must be named `{scene}`. If it has any other name you are
  connected to someone else's Blender. Change nothing, reply exactly
  `WRONG BLENDER` and stop.
- {start}
- execute_blender_code runs in safe mode: only bpy, bmesh, mathutils and pure
  standard-library modules (math, random, itertools...) import. No os, sys,
  numpy, open(), file or network access; files are written only through bpy
  operators and the export_scene tool.
- Work in small steps: one part or one fix per execute_blender_code call (a
  call must return within 180 s), and look at get_viewport_screenshot after
  every meaningful step. Read blender_version from get_addon_status and use
  bpy_api_lookup instead of guessing an API that changes between versions.
- Wherever a tool takes `user_prompt`, pass the literal string "codex-3d".
  Never paste this prompt into it.

Contract for the object:
- Blender units are metres and Z is up. The object rests on the ground plane
  z = 0, is centred on x = 0 and y = 0, and its FRONT FACES -Y (Blender's
  front view). The glTF export turns that into three.js space: Y up, resting
  on y = 0, front facing +Z. Real-world size: a car is ~4.5 m long, a mug
  ~0.1 m tall.
- One root Empty at the world origin, named after the object, with every
  other object parented under it.
- Every part the specification names is its own object (or an Empty pivot
  with children) carrying exactly that name, with its origin at the natural
  pivot: a wheel's axle centre, a door's hinge line. The page finds parts with
  `gltf.scene.getObjectByName('wheel_fl')` and turns them about their origins.
  Names use lowercase letters, digits and underscores only: three.js rewrites
  dots and spaces, so Blender's automatic `.001` suffix breaks the lookup.
- Apply scale (object scale 1, 1, 1) on every mesh.
- Materials: Principled BSDF only, driven by plain values (base colour,
  metallic, roughness, coat, transmission, alpha, emission colour and
  strength). Those export to glTF PBR. No image textures and no procedural
  texture or shader-math nodes: they do not survive the export. Look nodes up
  by type, never by name. One named material per distinct surface.
- Idle animation only if the specification asks for one: keyframe object
  transforms on the parts as a loop that ends in its starting pose. It exports
  as glTF animation clips. Otherwise leave no animation data.
- No lights, cameras or helper geometry in the scene (the viewer supplies an
  environment map, key/rim lights and shadows).
- Budget: under 200,000 triangles after modifiers. Prefer fewer, better-shaped
  pieces.
- Quality bar: it must read as the real thing from every angle. Correct
  proportions, continuous silhouette, no gaps, no floating or intersecting
  parts, no z-fighting, symmetric where the object is symmetric. Use what
  Blender is good at: bmesh and from_pydata hulls, curves, and mirror, bevel,
  solidify, subdivision and boolean modifiers (applied on export), smooth
  shading with sharp edges where the form has them. A pile of plain cubes and
  cylinders is a failure unless the object really is cubes and cylinders.
- Finish in this order, and again after every later fix:
  1. save the source with execute_blender_code:
     bpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath="{build_dir}/object.blend")
  2. export with the export_scene tool: filepath "{build_dir}/object.glb",
     object_names [your root Empty], apply_modifiers true
  3. in your shell run `node check.mjs object.glb`. It loads the exported file
     the way three.js will and checks the contract, bounds and triangle
     budget. Fix what it reports in Blender until it prints OK.
